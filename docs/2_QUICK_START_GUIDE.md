# 2. Quick Start Guide

## 2.1 Overview

Cobalt is a tool for developers who are interested in reusing or contributing new cloud infrastructure as code patterns in template form. An actualized infrastructure as code pattern in Cobalt is called a *Cobalt Infrastructure Template* or *CIT* (/kÉªt/). Cobalt Infrastructure Templates rely on *Terraform* as the scripting language of choice.

You can get pretty creative and build your own custom CITs in order to use and/or contribute to Cobalt but we strongly recommend that you first complete this quick start guide. This guide is centered around our existing [*Azure Hello World CIT*](../infra/templates/az-hello-world/README.md) and should server as your first infrastructure deployment. In summary, completing this guide should be your first major step in familiarizing yourself with Cobalt and the CIT developer workflow. Happy templating! ðŸ˜„

## 2.2 Goals and Objectives

- Use the [*Azure Hello World CIT*](../infra/templates/az-hello-world/README.md) as an introductory template for provisioning your Azure resources
- Walk away with a introductory understanding of the CIT developer workflow
- Feel confident in moving forward to our next recommended section: --> *[Cobalt Templating from Scratch](./3_NEW_TEMPLATE.md).*

## 2.3 Prerequisites

  * App dev experience (Previous "Infrastructure as Code" experience not required)
  * An Azure Subscription
  * A [service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal)
  * An Azure Storage Account for tracking terraform remote backend state. You can use our backend state setup [template](../infra/templates/backend-state-setup/README.md) to provision the storage resources.
  * WSL or Bash
  * Local environment [setup](https://github.com/microsoft/cobalt/tree/master/test-harness#local-environment-setup)
  * Install [git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)
  * Install [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
  * Azure CLI
    * [Get started with Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
