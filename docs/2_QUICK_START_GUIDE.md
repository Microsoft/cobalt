# 2. Quick Start Guide

## 2.1 Overview

**C**obalt is a tool for developers who are interested in reusing or contributing new cloud infrastructure as code patterns in template form. An actualized infrastructure as code pattern in Cobalt is called a *Cobalt Infrastructure Template* or *CIT* (/kÉªt/). Although you can get pretty creative and build your own custom CIT in order to use and/or contribute to Cobalt, we strongly recommend completing this quick start guide, a guide which resuses our existing [*Azure Hello World CIT*](../infra/templates/az-hello-world/README.md) for infrastructure deployment. Completing this guide should be the first major step in familiarizing yourself with Cobalt and the CIT developer workflow. Happy templating!

## 2.2 Goals and Objectives

- Use the *Azure Hello World CIT* as an introductory template for provisioning your Azure resources
- Walk away with a basic understanding of the CIT developer workflow
- Feel confident in moving forward to the next recommended section: *[Cobalt Templating](./3_NEW_TEMPLATE.md).*

## 2.3 Prerequisites
