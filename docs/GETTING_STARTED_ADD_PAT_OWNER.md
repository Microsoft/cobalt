## Overview

The goal of this document is to leverage Azure DevOps to operationalize Cobalt Infrastructure Templates. Completion of these steps results in a configured source code management flow and unified pipeline within Azure DevOps ready for multi-stage environments in Azure.

This section provides Cobalt users instructions for initializing and integrating Cobalt into their existing Azure DevOps organization using an Azure subscription. These steps assume some basic familiarity with the Azure DevOps portal, the Azure Cloud portal and a desire to automate the creation of infrastructure. For more information on Cobalt, visit the following link: [READ ME](../README.md)

## Prerequisites

  1. An Azure Subscription
  2. Azure DevOps Organization
  3. Permissions to your Organization's Azure DevOps account
  4. An Azure Active Directory Application with a *Global administrator role* permission in your Organization's Tenant. This role is granted the right to create service principals.

> NOTE: If this is not allowed by your organization tenant, completion of step two and the Service Connection creation in step three will need to be completed by someone within your organization with this permission.

### STEPS

1. **Initialize Azure DevOps Repo with Cobalt**

    The following steps help setup an Azure DevOps repo with Cobalt Infrastructure Templates that you can host and deploy. The end result is a cloned Cobalt repo that also comes with a ready to be integrated pipeline configuration file needed for automating your infrastructure deployments in Azure DevOps.

    * Create a new project
        1. Sign-in to Azure DevOps (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/)
        1. Create new project under Organization. First create new Organization if it doesn't exist. (ex. Cobalt-`<Your-Company-Name>`)

            ![alt text](./images/Org.png "Create Organization")
            ![alt text](./images/project.png "Create Project")

    * Create new repository by fetching source code from the master branch of Cobalt's open-source github project. This will allow you to host and grow your own repo for Cobalt Infrastructure Templates.
        1. Select Repos tab within side-navigation menu
        1. Select 'Import a repository' from the Repos tab sub-menu and click [Import]
        1. Enter the Cobalt Clone URL (https://github.com/microsoft/cobalt.git) and select Import

            ![Clone Button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10041279/63459072-8ec4cf00-c419-11e9-8ef4-ee7db827e49c.png)

    * Personalize the project by renaming your cloned Cobalt repo.
        1. Click your Repo Name (ex. Cobalt-`<Your-Company-Name>`) at the top of the page.

            ![Repo Name dropdown](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10041279/63615290-9d8ebb80-c5aa-11e9-9136-64295640205b.png)

        1. Select Manage Repositories
        1. Under Git repositories, find "Cobalt-`<Your-Company-Name>`" and select the ellipses
        1. Select Rename repository

            ![Rename Repo dropdown](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10041279/63615540-3b828600-c5ab-11e9-9174-07f23b3193bf.png)

        1. Give it a new name and click [Rename]

            | Naming Recommendation  | Template Repo Strategy |
            |-------------|-----------|
            | Cobalt-Hello-World-`<Your-Company-Name>` | If the aim is to introduce oneself or the organization to Cobalt, we recommended a name that assumes this repo will only be hosting the Azure Hello World Cobalt Infrastructure Template. |
            | Cobalt-AZ-ISO-`<Your-Company-Name>` | If already familiar with Cobalt and the aim is to have a single repository represent a single Cobalt Infrastructure Template, and thereafter, to have one repo per template, we recommend a name that reflects the Cobalt Infrastructure Template being deployed. In this naming example, the name assumes this repo will be dedicated to deploying the Cobalt *az-isolated-service-single-region* Infrastructure Template |
            | Cobalt-`<Your-Company-Name>` | If already familiar with Cobalt ad the aim is to use a single repository as ground truth for all potential patterns across your organization, effectively having to manage a combination of Cobalt patterns from a single repo, it's recommended to stick with a name that matches the project name. |

    * Initialize a new Azure DevOps pipeline by integrating an existing YAML file. This file already lives within the newly created repo and is needed as Azure DevOps uses it to orchestrate your Cobalt Infrastructure Template deployments across various deployment stages. By integrating this file, a unified deployment pipeline is executed for you.
        1. Select Pipelines tab from within side-navigation menu
           
           ![alt text](./images/pipline.png "Create Pipline")

        1. Select New Pipeline and then choose 'Azure Repos Git [YAML]'

            ![Pipeline Menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10041279/63459652-89b44f80-c41a-11e9-829a-05a6888b7673.png)

        1. Find and select the newly created repository from dropdown menu
        1. Import YAML by selecting 'Existing Azure Pipelines YAML file'
            * Enter the path to the devops yaml file that lives within your newly created repo. (i.e. devops/providers/azure-devops/templates/azure-pipelines.yml)

            ![Select YAML](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10041279/63459938-21b23900-c41b-11e9-9b9c-2dfa72e51350.png)

            > NOTE: Automatic drop-down does not always populate with yaml file options. It may be necessary to simply copy and paste the above path.
        1. Review the devops pipeline YAML file and only keep references to Cobalt Infrastructure Templates that your organization would like to deploy. This step helps configure the Azure DevOps project to rely on this file in order to build and deploy the referenced Cobalt Infrastructure Templates across various deployment stages.
            * Remove jobName configurations that reference Cobalt Infrastructure Templates not intended for deployment. If new to Cobalt, we recommend keeping the jobName that references our az_hello_world infrastructure template as a starter template. This step can also be completed later as a code commit to your repo. Below is an example of a jobName that you may want to remove by simply deleting the section from the file.
                ```yaml
                configurationMatrix:
                - jobName: az_service_single_region
                terraformTemplatePath: 'infra/templates/az-service-single-region'
                terraformWorkspacePrefix: 'sr'
                environmentsToTeardownAfterRelease:
                - 'devint'
                ```
        1. Save and run

            ![Fail Screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10041279/63546484-8ccd3f80-c4ef-11e9-8d9f-2f06dc725fc7.png)

            > NOTE: Azure Devops forces a run so expect this to fail. Future steps will resolve this problem.

2. **Provision Azure resources needed for Azure Devops pipeline**

    Follow this step to setup Azure resources (i.e. Azure Blob Storage, etc.) in the appropriate Azure Subscription. Later, these resources will need to be referenced in your Azure DevOps test automation pipeline in order to make the pipeline fully functional. Without this step, you cannot deploy Cobalt Infrastructure Templates to Azure DevOps.

    * Create a registered Azure AD (AAD) app for Cobalt deployments
        1. Sign-in to your organization's Azure account. (https://portal.azure.com)
        2. Filter for Azure Active Directory and navigate to it's menu
        3. Select App registrations from the menu blade
           
           ![alt text](./images/AppReg.png "App Registrations")

        4. Click [Add/+] New registration then enter a name for the application (ex. cobalt-hw-admin-sp-`<username>` or cobalt-az-iso-admin-sp-`<username>`)
        5. Choose single tenant as a supported account type
        6. Click Register

    * Setup permissions for the new AAD app to also use legacy API permissions
        1. From the App registrations service blade, select the API permissions
           
           ![alt text](./images/api-permissions.png "API Permissions")

        3. Configure Azure Activity Directory Application permissions to ReadWrite.OwnedBy. First select Microsoft Graph and then select Application Permissions

            ![Request Permissions menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10041279/63549279-b6896500-c4f5-11e9-9c92-40ac2a4295c9.png)

        4. Click [Add permissions] to save this configuration
        5. Click [Grant admin consent for *Your Directory*] to grant consent on behalf of users in this directory for this permission 

    * Configure the new AAD app as a Cobalt admin service-principal/service-endpoint
        1. From the App registrations service blade, click the [Certificates & secrets] tab
        2. Click [+New client secret] from within the Client secrets menu then enter a description (ex. rbac)

            ![Client Secret menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10041279/63461963-69d35a80-c41f-11e9-8d4a-c72235177fb3.png)

        3. Click Add
            > IMPORTANT: Generate a secret that does not have a trailing slash. Secrets that lead with a slash (ex."/","\") may cause parsing errors.

            > NOTE: Take note of the generated client secret (only displayed once). This will be used for your Azure DevOps Service Connection in step 3.
        4. From the App registrations service blade, select Overview.
            > NOTE: Take note of the Application (client) ID. This will also be used for your Azure DevOps Service Connection in step 3.

    * Grant newly created Service Principal an Owner role to your preferred enterprise subscription.

        This elevates the Service Principal with more permissions so that Terraform can rely on this Service Principal as an Azure user for Cobalt Infrastructure Template deployments.

        1. Filter for subscriptions and navigate to the subscriptions list
        2. Either choose a subscription or create a new one (ex. Cobalt-`<Your-Company-Name>`-Deployments)
        3. Select your chosen subscription then select the Access control (IAM) tab from the menu blade.
        4. Click [+/Add] and select Add role assignment
        5. From the sub-menu, select 'Owner' as a role from the drop down and search for the newly created Service Principal (i.e. cobalt-hw-admin-sp-`<username>` or cobalt-az-iso-admin-sp-`<username>`)

            ![Role Assignment menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31149154/63708249-7ed23400-c7f9-11e9-8dbb-c15dcdaf3a37.png)

        6. Click Save

    * Create Resource Group and Storage Account for backend state
        1. Filter for Storage accounts and navigate to the storage account list
        2. Click [+/Add] and enter values for the following fields:
            * Subscription: Your preferred enterprise subscription for Cobalt template deployments
            * Resource group: Create new (ex. cobalt-devint-hw-admin-rg or cobalt-devint-az-iso-admin-rg )
            * Storage account name: (ex. cobalttfstates)
        3. Click [Review+Create] then [Create]
        4. Once deployment for storage account is completed, go to the resource and visit the Blobs sub-menu
        5. Click [+Container] then create a container name (ex. az-hw-remote-state-container or az-iso-remote-state-container) with private access

3. **Configure Azure DevOps pipeline by referencing Azure resources created in your Azure Cloud Subscription**

    The goal of this step is to have the Azure Devops pipeline referencing the appropriate Azure resources (i.e. Azure Blob Storage Account, etc.) living within your Azure Cloud Subscription. This will ensure that infrastructure deployments are impacting the desired Azure Cloud Subscription and that the deployment process is permissioned to perform various operations needed for proper build and integration across various deployment stages.

    * Add the Azure Subscription being used for Cobalt as a *Service Connection*
        1. Return to your Azure DevOps subscription
        2. Find and select the Project Settings tab at the bottom of the screen
        3. Under the Pipelines menu select Service Connections
        4. From the Service Connections menu, select [+New Service Connection]
        5. Choose Azure Resource Manager from the dropdown then a name for your service (ex. Cobalt Deployment Administrator-`<YourTenantName>`). The name should make sense to users and will be directly referenced in pipeline variable groups later.
        6. Use the full version of the service connection dialog in order to enter your service principal credentials (AAD Key, AAD App ID, Tenant, etc.)

            ![Service Connection menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10041279/63485304-63b59c00-c468-11e9-8e47-721a2e43ecb9.png)

        7. Verify and Save the connection
        > NOTE: Take note of the custom name given to this service connection. This will be referenced in later steps needed to configure env variable groups.

    * Enable multi-stage pipelines
        1. Find your signed-in avatar/image and select preview features from the drop down menu

            ![Preview Features menu](./images/preview.png)

        2. Toggle Multi-stage pipelines

    * Configure *Infrastructure Pipeline Variables* as the first of two variable groups
        1. Select Pipelines tab from within side-navigation menu then select Library tab
        2. Click [+Variable group] and name it "Infrastructure Pipeline Variables"
        3. Create a list of required variables. These variables can be found by visiting the *[Gloal Variable Group](./../devops/providers/azure-devops/templates/infrastructure/README.md#Global-Variable-Group)* section of our Azure DevOps infrastructure readme.

    * Configure *DevInt Environment Variables* as the final variable group
        1. Environment-specific variables have no default values and must be assigned
        2. Return to the Library tab
        3. Click [+Variable group] and name it *DevInt Environment Variables*
        4. Create a list of required variables. These variables can be found by visiting the *[Stage Specific Pipeline Variables](./../devops/providers/azure-devops/templates/infrastructure/README.md#Stage-Specific-Pipeline-Variables)* section of our Azure DevOps infrastructure readme.

    * Link Variable Groups for DevInt and Infrastructure to the Build Pipeline
        1. Select Pipelines tab from within side-navigation menu
        2. Select existing pipeline and then click [Edit]
        3. Next to the [Variables] button at the top of the page, click the ellipses and select Triggers

            ![Triggers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41071421/63284806-022fda80-c27a-11e9-8e23-494314c63651.png)

        4. Navigate to the [Variables] tab and begin linking each variable group
        5. Link each variable group, one by one

            ![Link Variable Groups](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10041279/63489261-3b816980-c477-11e9-87bf-1d254226e8fd.png)

        6. Save the build pipeline

4. **Clone newly created Azure DevOps Repo from your organization**

    With this step, the goal is to pull down the repo into a local environment so that one can begin making code changes.

    * Visit your newly created repo and clone down the repo.

        ![git Clone button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10041279/63484822-9f4f6680-c466-11e9-8aa5-13ad9ba763d9.png)

        ```bash
        $ git clone <insert-git-repo-url>
        ```

5. **Keep the templates relevant to your enterprise patterns**

    The goal of this step is to continue efforts removing Cobalt Infrastructure Template directories that users have no interest in deploying.

    * Open the project from your favorite IDE and navigate to infrastructure templates `./infra/templates` directory.
    * Manually delete template directories not needed for your enterprise. (Do not delete 'backend-state-setup' template! We also recommended keeping the 'az-hello-world' template as a starter template.)

    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10041279/64913136-1d1e2f00-d700-11e9-95cd-9e95c257bcbd.png)

    * Commit the newly pruned project to your newly forked repo.
        ```bash
        $ git commit -m "Removed unrelated templates." && git push
        ```

    > NOTE: The CI/CD pipeline needs to detect a code change to run the template-specific build and release jobs (in their respective stages). To force the template build and release to run, you may add a `FORCE_RUN` environment variable with a value of `true` to your *devint Environment Variables* variable group. You may also add a comment or extra line to a TF or Go file within the template in order for the pipeline script to detect a change without adding any additional override flags.

## Additional Recommendations

Recommended next step is to target containerized applications via their image names from within a Cobalt Infrastructure Template.
