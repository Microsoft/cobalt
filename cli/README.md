# Cobalt CLI

Currently this only contains the start of the project structure, a test concept, Makefile and Readme. From a terminal, cd into the `cli` folder and run:

```make deps```
```make build```
```make run```
```make test```

We are currently only using go-cobra and go-testing packages just to get something committed.
