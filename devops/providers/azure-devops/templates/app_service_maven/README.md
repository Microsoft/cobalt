# CICD Maven Service Pipeline Bootstrap Templates

These YAML templates are designed to be included in individual service repositories, configured through Azure DevOps as the primary Build pipeline. The bootstrap delegates the pipeline implementation back to a shared YAML `app_service_maven` Pipeline defined in devops/providers/azure-devops/templates/app_service_maven/examples/maven_service_usage_example.yml
